# Temporary Translation Workflow

This document details how the html for Janis can be downloaded and highlighted to send to translators. This process will also generate a .csv file for translations to be added to, if desired. The intent is to trial a translation workflow and identify opportunities for improvement and then to iterate. 

### Requirements: 

This workflow has only been tested in Chrome using the Chrome extensions 
[Single File](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/singlefile/mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle?hl=en)
and it's dependency [Single File Core](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/singlefile-core/jemlklgaibiijojffihnhieihhagocma?hl=en). 

To begin, click the links and then click the 'add to chrome' button to install both. 
Once installed, you'll see the Single File Icon ![Single File Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/master/WebContent/ui/resources/icon_19.png) to the right of your browser location bar.

### Steps:

#### 1. Navigate to the page you'd like to download and highlight for translations.
In this sample, I'll use the [Curbside Pickup Page](http://alpha.austin.gov/services/compost-pickup)

#### 2. Download the page 
You'll click the Single File icon in your browser bar and wait a few minutes. 
Then click the link labeled *Click here to save the page* which should show in a yellow-ish bar. 
You can view a demo of at the [Single File](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/singlefile/mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle?hl=en) download site.

### If you don't require highlighting, your process ends here. 
Try loading the page you've downloaded in a browser to ensure the page renders as expected.
**Remember, this page will not have any javascript functionality** (menus and forms will likely be inoperable, but most links will work).
Once you've verified everything looks as expected, you can email or send this file as you would any other.
