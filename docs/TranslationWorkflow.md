# Temporary Translation Workflow

This document details how the html for Janis can be downloaded and highlighted to send to translators. This process will also generate a .csv file for translations to be added to, if desired. The intent is to trial a translation workflow and identify opportunities for improvement and then to iterate. 

### Requirements: 

This workflow has only been tested in Chrome using the Chrome extensions
